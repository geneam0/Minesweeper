# Minesweeper
Single player game played on the terminal

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

I wrote this in my AP Computer Science class in my Junior year of high school. Looking back, this code is very inefficient and redundant. Nevertheless, I learned a lot from this project and enjoyed coding it.

To play, type `javac Minesweeper.java`
