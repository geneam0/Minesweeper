# Minesweeper
Single player game played on the terminal

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them using clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

I wrote this in my AP Computer Science class during high school. Looking back, this code is very inefficient and redundant. Nevertheless, I learned a lot from this project and enjoyed coding it.

To play, 
1. Clone or Download this repo
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the Minesweeper directory
3. Type `javac Minesweeper.java` and then `java Minesweeper` to start the game.

From there on, you can choose how many rows and columns you want to play with and mark/flag/choose where to uncover the mines.

Have fun! I included a demo.mp4 in case you get stuck after starting the game.
